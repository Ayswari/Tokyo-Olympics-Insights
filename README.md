<p>As data engineers we are expected to convert this raw data into information that
can be interpreted by data scientists and business analysts. We need to create a
power BI report that will help us gain insights about details such as:</p>
<li>Gender distribution across various Olympics disciplines</li>
<li>Medals distribution across the countries</li>
<li>Discipline distribution across the countries</li>
